# Workshop on Predictive Simulations of Human Movement - Barcelona 2024

Welcome to the Workshop on Predictive Simulations of Human Movement repository!

This repo contains the resources used during the workshop. Below is a list of the 5 seminars:
- S1 Modelling assistive devices
- S2 How do we choose the weights in the cost function
- S3 Integration of mesh-based contact models
- S4 Modelling neuromusculoskeletal deficits
- S5 Mechanistic muscle models

Seminar specific information can be found in the respective folders.
