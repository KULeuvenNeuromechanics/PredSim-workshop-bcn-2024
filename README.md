# PredSim-workshop-bcn-2024
Material for PredSim workship September 2024 (Barcelona)

This repository will be made public and shared with the participants of the workshop.

While we are still adding content, the repo is set to private access.

Some suggestions to maintain an overview of the content in this repo:
- each session has its own folder
- for the hands-on sessions, this folder contains: 
    - a document with instrucions (pdf or md)
    - a matlab script for each example
    - supporting code/files for the examples
- for PredSim sessions, use [this script](./Modelling%20assistive%20devices/example_1.m) as a template for the "main" of each example
